This is the beginning of my journey programming in Python.

As part of the ALX Africa Software Engineering Programme, there will be several projects written in Python.

pip 22.3.1  will be used for all projects.
Python 3.11.0 is the version I will be using.
pycodestyle 2.10.0 is the style guide for all projects.
